;;; Commentary:

;; dired-rmjunk is a port of Jakub Klinkovský's home directory cleanup tool to
;; Dired. The interactive function, `dired-rmjunk' will mark all files in the
;; current Dired buffer that match one of the patterns specified in
;; `dired-rmjunk-patterns'. The tool is intended as a simple means for
;; keeping one's home directory tidy -- removing "junk" dotfiles.

;; The script that this is based on can be found at:
;; <https://github.com/lahwaacz/Scripts/blob/master/rmshit.py>

  that the regexp specified by the pattern matches the file-name.
  2. If the pattern lacks a directory component, matching means
  that that the regexp specified by the file-name component of
  the pattern matches the file-name, AND the regexp specified by
