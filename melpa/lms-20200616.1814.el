* Introduction
This is an *emacs* frontend to interact with Squeezebox Server / Logitech Media Server.
Released under GPL version 3 license or later.

It requires emacs version 25 or higher.

More information on what a *squeezebox controller* is at https://inigo.katxi.org/blog/2017/07/31/lms_el.html.

Quick instructions: customize some basic parameters such as 'lms-url' and run it with *lms* or *lms-ui*.
From there, you could read complete documentation after pressing *h* key.
You can also run 'emacsclient -e \"(lms-float)\"' to display an independent small frame.

Package should appear in [[https://melpa.org][MELPA repository]], and the code is in [[https://hg.serna.eu/emacs/lms][the code repository]] as well.

* Features
This is Squeezebox controller, i.e. a program which can handle your local music library.

Some of the features:
- Display song: title, artist, album, year, cover…
- Play, pause, stop, select next / previous song
- Control players: select player, power on/off, volume, repeat and shuffle modes
- Playlist control: list, select song, delete track, clear
- Show track information and change rating

It is not aimed to be a complete controller, as it can't - and won't - manage external sources such us BBC, Deezer, Pandora, Spotify, or TuneIn Radio.

* Configuration
There are some parameters you could customize:
|----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------------|
| Parameter                        | Description                                             | Default                |
|----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------------|
| lms-url                          | Logitech Media Server hostname or ip and port           | http://lms_server:9000 |
| lms-default-player               | Name of default player                                  | nil  (1)               |
| lms-ui-cover-width               | Cover image width                                       | 500  (2)               |
| lms-ui-update-interval           | Time in seconds between UI updates                      | 1    (3)               |
| lms-number-recent-albums         | Number of recent albums to show                         | 25                     |
| lms-number-random-albums         | Number of random albums to show                         | 25                     |
| lms-number-random-songs          | Number of random songs to show                          | 50                     |
| lms-use-helm-in-library-browsing | Use helm to select item in library browsing             | nil  (4)               |
| lms-helm-candidate-number-limit  | Maximum number of candidates to show in items selection | 9999 (5)               |
|----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------------|
Notes:
(1) If *lms-default-player* is not defined or a player with that name does not exist, it will ask for one at start.
(2) It's recomendable not to change *lms-ui-cover-width*.
(3) Note that small values in *lms-ui-update-interval* could freeze your Emacs use while refreshing window.
(4) Enabling *lms-use-helm-in-library-browsing* could make artists and albums retrieval slow. Thus *ido* is used by default.
(5) If you use helm and items selection is slow set a smaller number for *lms-helm-candidate-number-limit*: 1000, 250, 100…
** Faces
The colors and font attributes of text can be customized in some views:
|-------------------+----------------+---------------------|
