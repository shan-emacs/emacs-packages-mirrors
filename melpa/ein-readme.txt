Emacs IPython Notebook (EIN) lets you run Jupyter (formerly IPython)
notebooks within Emacs.  It channels all the power of Emacs without the
idiosyncrasies of in-browser editing.

No require statements, e.g. ``(require 'ein)``, are necessary, contrary to the
`prevailing documentation`_, which should be disregarded.

*EIN has multiple* Issues_ *with minified ipynb, Doom, and Spacemacs.*

Org_ users please find ob-ein_, a jupyter Babel_ backend.

`Google Compute Engine`_ integration is in alpha.

EIN was originally written by `[tkf]`_.  A jupyter Babel_ backend was first
introduced by `[gregsexton]`_.
