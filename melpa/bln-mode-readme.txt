Navigating the cursor across long lines of text by keyboard in Emacs can be
cumbersome, since commands like `forward-char', `backward-char',
`forward-word', and `backward-word' move sequentially, and potentially
require a lot of repeated executions to arrive at the desired position.  This
package provides the binary line navigation minor-mode (`bln-mode'), to
address this issue.  It defines the commands `bln-forward-half' and
`bln-backward-half', which allow for navigating from any position in a line to
any other position in that line by recursive binary subdivision.

For instance, if the cursor is at position K, invoking `bln-backward-half' will
move the cursor to position K/2. Successively invoking `bln-forward-half'
(without moving the cursor in between invocations) will move the cursor to
K/2 + K/4, whereas a second invocation of `bln-backward-half' would move the
cursor to K/2 - K/4.

Below is an illustration of how you can use binary line navigation to reach
character `e' at column 10 from character `b' at column 34 in four steps:

                  ________________|    bln-backward-half (\\[bln-backward-half])
         ________|                     bln-backward-half (\\[bln-backward-half])
        |___                           bln-forward-half  (\\[bln-forward-half])
           _|                          bln-backward-half (\\[bln-backward-half])
..........e.......................b.....

This approach requires at most log(N) invocations to move from any position
to any other position in a line of N characters.  Note that when you move in
the wrong direction---by mistakenly invoking `bln-backward-half' instead of
`bln-forward-half' or vice versa---you can interrupt the current binary
navigation sequence by moving the cursor away from its current position (for
example, by `forward-char'). You can then start the binary navigation again
from that cursor position.

In an analogous manner, `bln-mode` allows for vertical binary
navigation across the visible lines in the window, using the
`bln-backward-half-v` and `bln-forward-half-v` commands.

The default keybindings are as follows:

* `bln-backward-half`   (\\[bln-backward-half])
* `bln-forward-half`    (\\[bln-forward-half])
* `bln-backward-half-v` (\\[bln-backward-half-v])
* `bln-forward-half-v`  (\\[bln-forward-half-v])

Navigation using thse keybindings is rather cumbersome
however. Using the `hydra` package, the following bindings
provide a much more convenient interface:

    (defhydra hydra-bln ()
      \"Binary line navigation mode\"
      (\"j\" bln-backward-half \"Backward in line\")
      (\"k\" bln-forward-half \"Forward in line\")
      (\"u\" bln-backward-half-v \"Backward in window\")
      (\"i\" bln-forward-half-v \"Forward in window\"))
    (define-key bln-mode-map (kbd \"M-j\") 'hydra-bln/body)
