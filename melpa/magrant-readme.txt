An attempt at a Vagrant procelain inside Emacs.

Allows you to perform (almost) any action you could do with the command-line at the comfort of an interface inspired by magit.

No special configuration is needed, just call `magrant` or directly `magrant-boxes` or `magrant-machines` to get started.

All action work on any number of entry.  So you could for example start all your machines at once or SSH into half of them.
