With this package you can easily enable/disable proxies per protocol in you Emacs.
You could also use this package to provide proxy settings for a group of s-expressions.
All the package does to your environment is operating the global variable `url-proxy-services',
Every time you enable/disable proxies, `url-proxy-services' will be saved into your `custom.el'.
