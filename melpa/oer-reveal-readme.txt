The package *oer-reveal* extends *org-re-reveal* (available on
MELPA and at https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal) with resources
and functionality that aim to simplify the creation of Open
Educational Resources (OER).  This package defines an Org mode
export backend derived from *org-re-reveal* for export to HTML with
reveal.js.  It provides help in installing and configuring
reveal.js and several of its plugins and forms the basis of
emacs-reveal (https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal).

See file README.md for more information; examples are included
under subdirectory "examples".

Package *oer-reveal* is really meant to be used as part of
emacs-reveal (https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal).
