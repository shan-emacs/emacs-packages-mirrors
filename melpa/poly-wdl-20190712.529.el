  (pm-host-chunkmode :name "wdl"
                     :mode 'wdl-mode)
  "WDL host chunkmode."
  :group 'poly-hostmodes
  :type 'object)

(defcustom poly-wdl-pm-inner-command-short
  (pm-inner-chunkmode :name "command"
                      :head-matcher "^[ \t]*command *{ *\n"
                      :tail-matcher "^[ \t]*} *\n"
                      :head-mode 'host
