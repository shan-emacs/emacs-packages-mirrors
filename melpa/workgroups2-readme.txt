Workgroups2 is an Emacs session manager. It is based on the
experimental branch of the original "workgroups" extension.

If you find a bug - please post it here:
https://github.com/pashinin/workgroups2/issues

Quick start,

- use `wg-create-workgroup' to save current windows layout
- use `wg-open-workgroup' to open saved windows layout

Optionally, you can use minor-mode `workgroups-mode' by put below
line into .emacs ,

(workgroups-mode 1)

Most commands start with prefix `wg-prefix-key'.
You can change it before activating workgroups.
Change prefix key (before activating WG)

(setq wg-prefix-key (kbd "C-c z"))

By default prefix is: "C-c z"

<prefix> <key>

<prefix> c    - create workgroup
<prefix> A    - rename workgroup
<prefix> k    - kill workgroup
<prefix> v    - switch to workgroup
<prefix> C-s  - save session
<prefix> C-f  - load session
<prefix> ?    -  for more help

Change workgroups session file,
(setq wg-session-file "~/.emacs.d/.emacs_workgroups"
