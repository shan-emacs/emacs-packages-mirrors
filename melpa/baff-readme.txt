Sometimes it is desirable to generate a byte array from a file for
directly including into source code.

`baff` provides this functionality via `M-x baff` and prompts for
a filename, then creates a buffer containing that file's bytes as
a byte array, eg:

#include <array>
// source : c:/dev/baff/README.md
// sha256 : b2d9aa7ed942cf08d091f3cce3dd56603fef00f5082573cd8b8ad987d29d4351

std::array<uint8_t,10> bytes = {
    0x23, 0x20, 0x62, 0x61, 0x66, 0x66, 0x0d, 0x0a, 0x43, 0x72
};

This buffer can then be manipulated or saved how you wish.

The default style is C++ but this can be changed to whatever style
is desired via `M-x customize-group RET baff RET`
