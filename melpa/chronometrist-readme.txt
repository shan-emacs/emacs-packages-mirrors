A time tracker in Emacs with a nice interface

Largely modelled after the Android application, [A Time Tracker](https://github.com/netmackan/ATimeTracker)

* Benefits
  1. Extremely simple and efficient to use
  2. Displays useful information about your time usage
  3. Support for both mouse and keyboard
  4. Human errors in tracking are easily fixed by editing a plain text file
  5. Hooks to let you perform arbitrary actions when starting/stopping tasks

* Limitations
  1. No support (yet) for adding a task without clocking into it.
  2. No support for concurrent tasks.

## Comparisons
### timeclock.el
Compared to timeclock.el, Chronometrist
* stores data in an s-expression format rather than a line-based one
* supports attaching tags and arbitrary key-values to time intervals
* has commands to shows useful summaries
* has more hooks

### Org time tracking
Chronometrist and Org time tracking seem to be equivalent in terms of capabilities, approaching the same ends through different means.
* Chronometrist doesn't have a mode line indicator at the moment. (planned)
* Chronometrist doesn't have Org's sophisticated querying facilities. (an SQLite backend is planned)
* Org does so many things that keybindings seem to necessarily get longer. Chronometrist has far fewer commands than Org, so most of the keybindings are single keys, without modifiers.
* Chronometrist's UI makes keybindings discoverable - they are displayed in the buffers themselves.
* Chronometrist's UI is cleaner, since the storage is separate from the display. It doesn't show tasks as trees like Org, but it uses tags and key-values to achieve that. Additionally, navigating a flat list takes fewer user operations than navigating a tree.
* Chronometrist data is just s-expressions (plists), and may be easier to parse than a complex text format with numerous use-cases.
