This package obtains your current location by obtaining the MAC
addresses of nearby wifi access points and then submitting that
list to third-party geolocation APIs.  Those geolocation services
use the known locations of the wifi access points and the relative
strength of each signal to triangulate your latitude and longitude.

The main entry point is:

- `geolocation-update-position' which calls `geolocation-get-position'
  on a regular interval, and sets `geolocation-location' with the
  result.  The `geolocation-update-hook' functions are called after
  each update.  Customize the hook functions if you want to
  invoke functions based on your position, and customize the
  `geolocation-update-interval' with the time granularity you need,
  keeping in mind the underlying positioning APIs may have rate
  limits and/or costs associated with high frequency querying.

  The variable `geolocation-location' will contain nil or an alist:
  - `latitude' - latitude of the current position
  - `longitude' - longitude of the current position
  - `accuracy' - an error radius, in meters
  - `timestamp' - timestamp via `float-time'

Other potentially useful functions include:

- `geolocation-get-position' which retrieves your estimated position
  once and invokes a callback with the position data.  The callback
  receives an alist with the same format as `geolocation-location.'

- `geolocation-scan-wifi' which scans asynchronously for nearby wifi
  access points using available system utilities, and invokes a callback
  with the wifi data.  The callback receives a list of alists containing:
  - `bssid' - mac address that uniquely identifies the AP
  - `signal' - relative signal strength, or RSSI
  - `channel' - transmission channel

- `geolocation-update-calendar' stores the latest position in
  `calendar-latitude' and `calendar-longitude'.  This function works
  as a `geolocation-update-hook'.

  At present, wifi scanning is supported on Mac OSX and Windows.
  Linux support is planned but not yet implemented.

You have a choice of third party services to use for the positioning:

- Google Maps Geolocation API
  https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro

- HERE Technologies Positioning API
  https://developer.here.com/develop/rest-apis

- Unwired Labs Location API
  https://unwiredlabs.com/home

This package offers a set of customizable variables you can use to
select which service is used, declare your API access token, choose
the nearest API endpoint, and so on.  Those settings can be found in
`M-x customize`, then browse for "Environment", then "hardware", and
then "Geolocation".

By default, access tokens are expected to be accessed via the built-in
`auth-source` package.  You can configure any backend, as this package
only requires the token to be searchable via
`auth-source-pick-first-password`.

Rate Limits and Costs:

Each of these services requires you to create your own account, and
potentially provide billing information as well.  You will be agreeing
to the vendor's end-user agreements including such things as
acceptable usage policies and privacy terms, when you create your
account.

Care has been taken to choose services that include either a free
tier, or equivalently, an allowance of a certain amount of usage per
day or per month.  It's your responsibility to set up your account
with those services, obtain and protect your token, and manage your
usage of those APIs because there can be associated costs if your
usage exceeds the usage terms of the subscription or plan you choose.

WARNING: THIS PACKAGE COLLECTS INFORMATION THAT IMPLIES YOUR PHYSICAL
LOCATION.  THAT DATA WILL BE SENT TO THIRD-PARTY GEOLOCATION SERVICES
WHICH CAN PINPOINT YOUR LOCATION TYPICALLY WITHIN 100 METERS OR LESS.
WHILE THIS PACKAGE DOES NOT ITSELF STORE YOUR LOCATION, WE CANNOT
GUARANTEE WHAT A GIVEN THIRD-PARTY SERVICE MAY DO WITH THE DATA IT
RECEIVES IN THESE API TRANSACTIONS.  RATHER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
TO THE PRIVACY AGREEMENTS AND END USER AGREEMENTS OF EACH OF THE
INDIVIDUAL GEOLOCATION APIS YOU USE.
