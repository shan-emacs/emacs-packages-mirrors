Smarter and more user-friendly interactive remote shell.

Provides `friendly-remote-shell', a command that eases the creation of
remote shells. It's basically a wrapper around `shell' with saner
defaults and additional keyword arguments.

It can also be used as a regular function (programmatically).

For detailed instructions, please look at the function documentation or
the README.md at
